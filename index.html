            <p class="paragraph"> Hi I'm Hannali Patidar. I currently work at JP Morgan, in Alternative Investments for
                the private bank. I graduated from Temple University in 2018. Now I am back in "school" learning to Full
                Stack Flex.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> While I do love my job and working, I find joy in any activities that involve family
                and friends. I also
                love trying new things, for the past year I have dedicated time towards fitness and training. I have
                tried new workouts like barre, hot yoga, and weight training. I think my next goal in fitness will be to
                run a marathon.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Iâ€™m excited to start this six moth Coding BootCamp. I want to learn and gain as much
                knowledge as possible. Hopefully I survive!
